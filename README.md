# React Dropdown with TypeScript Classes

This project demonstrates a custom dropdown component built from scratch in **React** using **TypeScript**. The dropdown can handle different models, where each model contains an `id` (key/value) and a `name` (text).

## Features

- Custom dropdown built from scratch using **React** and **Bootstrap**.
- Supports multiple data models (e.g., `Company` and `Employee`) passed to the dropdown as objects with `id` and `name` properties.
- Select an item and trigger an event (`onSelect`) with the selected item's `id`.
- Fully type-safe using **TypeScript** to define models and props.

## Tech Stack

- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** - Adds type safety to JavaScript.
- **Bootstrap** - A popular CSS framework for styling the components.
- **React Bootstrap** (optional for styling) or custom styling with Bootstrap classes.
